# Business-Insights-360---Power-BI-Project
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard developed using **Atliq Hardwares' data**. The project involved analyzing over **1 million data points** spread across 3 **fact tables** and accompanied by various **dimension tables**, and the goal was to derive actionable insights into the company's hardware business performance.

## üìä Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that can visualize key metrics and trends for **Atliq Hardwares**. The dashboard includes:

- **Sales Analysis**: Trends and patterns in sales data.
- **Revenue Breakdown**: Detailed breakdown of revenue by products, categories, and regions.
- **Profit Margins**: Visualizations showing gross profit and profit margin by various factors.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Insights into customer behavior and segments contributing to the business.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and building interactive dashboards.
- **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for advanced calculations and data modeling within Power BI.
- **Power Query**: For extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) the data into Power BI.
- **SQL**: To retrieve and manipulate the data from source systems.

## üìà Data

The dataset provided by **Atliq Hardwares** contained:

- Over **1 million data points** related to product sales, transactions, customers, etc.
- **Multiple dimension tables** such as `Products`, `Customers`, `Regions`, and `Date`.

These tables were linked through **primary and foreign key relationships**, and measures were created for meaningful insights.

### Key Columns/Fields:

- **Products**: Product Name, Category, Subcategory.
- **Sales**: Sales Quantity, Revenue, Profit.
- **Customer**: Customer Segment, Region.
- **Date**: Year, Quarter, Month.

## üîç Key Features of the Dashboard

- **Interactive Filtering**: Users can filter the dashboard by various dimensions such as product categories, regions, and time periods.
- **Dynamic KPIs**: Displaying dynamic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total revenue, and profit margins.
- **Drill-Through Capability**: Ability to drill through from high-level summaries into detailed records for in-depth analysis.

## üõ† Steps Involved

1. **Data Import**: Loaded data from various sources, including CSV files and databases.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Performed data cleaning in Power Query, including handling missing values, formatting columns, and merging tables.
3. **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between fact and dimension tables, created measures using DAX for sales, profit, and revenue.
4. **Data Visualization**: Developed multiple charts, graphs, and KPIs to visualize insights, such as:
    - Sales trends by product categories over time.
    - Regional performance with revenue distribution maps.
    - Profit analysis across various customer segments.

## üìÖ Timeline and Challenges

- **Duration**: This project took approximately **2 weeks** to complete.
- **Challenges**: Handling a large dataset of 1 million records required optimizing DAX queries and ensuring the dashboard remained responsive.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Open the Power BI file in Power BI Service:
   ```bash
